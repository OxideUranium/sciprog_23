# main.c
Define matrix A B C and call matrix multiplication in another .c file to calculate the result, and finally print the result. I initialized the three matrices separately to make it more intuitive.

# martix.c
This is a c file waiting to be called. There is only one function, which is about how to calculate 3x3 matrix multiplication

# Makefile
Decide that both files should be compiled
```
make
```
