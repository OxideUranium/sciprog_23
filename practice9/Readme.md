# Practice 9
This practice consists of a C program that checks if a given square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is one where the sum of every row, column, and both main diagonals are equal.

## magic_square.h
This header includes a function to calculate isMagicSquare. The input is int ** square, const int n, and the output is bool.

## main.c
This is the main entrance of the program, the user can input a file name, and the program will read the matrix in the file and judge whether it is a magic square.

## Other .txt file
These are files used for testing, including different matrices

## Compile and run
A Makefile is provided to compile the project.
```bash
Makefile
```
